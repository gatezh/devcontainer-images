# Patch every cached @playwright/mcp .mcp.json to launch the system chromium.
# Idempotent — safe to run on every container start.
#
# Why this exists:
#   @playwright/mcp's default --browser is the chrome channel, which looks at
#   /opt/google/chrome/chrome — we ship /usr/bin/chromium instead. The
#   PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH env var is a project convention, not
#   read by Playwright automatically, so MCP needs an explicit --executable-path.
#
# Why a loop instead of `find -print -quit`:
#   Plugin auto-updates extract into fresh cache dirs (one per version hash),
#   each with an unpatched .mcp.json. Patching only the first match (#64) left
#   newer cache dirs broken until container rebuild.
#
# Wire-up: invoke from postCreateCommand (init-plugins.sh) and postStartCommand
# (devcontainer.json) so plugin auto-updates between sessions get re-patched.
